        trackNote: 'Note: The current track generation algorithm is still experimental. It is normal to encounter any unexpected behavior; please report it to the developers.',
        trackGuide: 'How to use tracks:',
        track1: 'First, connect the wheels in sequence to form a closed loop. If you have two 1x3 wheels placed in series, you can also connect them in a Z-pattern. The connected wheels are the ones used for the track calculation. If your tank has many return rollers, you can selectively skip the ones in the middle to reduce the computational load.',
        track2: 'Next, place a Track Controller and connect it to one of the wheels in the loop to generate the track. Note: The choice of which wheel to connect is important. The entire track\'s rotation and movement animation is based on the rotation of the connected wheel. It is recommended to connect it to a wheel that touches the ground; this simulates friction between the track and the ground, but the drive wheel will slip against the track. If you connect it to the drive wheel, it will prevent it from slipping against the track, but the track itself will slip against the ground.',
        track3: 'When connecting the wheels into a loop, it is recommended to connect them counter-clockwise by default. If you connect them clockwise, it will change the forward orientation of the track.',
        track4: 'If you want the tracks on both sides to face the same forward direction, simply connect them clockwise or counter-clockwise from your current perspective, whether you\'re on the left or right side of the tank. You don\'t need to worry about the overall connection direction for the vehicle as a whole.',
        track5: 'The track effect will be destroyed immediately if a wheel in the loop is destroyed, a connection in the loop is manually removed, or the controller is removed.',
        track6: 'Try to place the Track Controller on the vehicle\'s main body, not on parts that rotate or move (e.g., a tank turret), because the tracks will twitch rapidly when these parts move.',
        track7: 'The track is generated at the average center point of all wheels (e.g., if one wheel is positioned further in and another further out, the track will be rendered midway between them). This is important to be aware of for tanks with misaligned wheels.',
        track8: 'The "Tank Drive Sprocket 2" will not be included in the average center point calculation because it is a half-sided drive wheel.',
        laserTitle: 'About Laser Guidance',
        laser1: 'The transmitter needs a code to be set. To use it, connect and activate a switch, which then allows the Laser Guidance Module to have its code switched manually.',
        laser2: 'When the Laser Guidance Module is connected by a Laser Coding Module, its code is controlled by the Laser Coding Module.',
        laser3: 'A Laser Coding Module can pass its signal on to the next Laser Coding Module.',

        // Track System Introduction
        trackSystemTitle: 'Track System Introduction',
        trackSystemDesc: 'This is an advanced track rendering and physics simulation system designed specifically for Scrap Mechanic. The system completely abandons traditional static textures or rigid model solutions, using Lua script-based dynamic geometry generation technology. It can intelligently identify the wheel structure of vehicles, automatically generate fitting track paths, and provide multiple operating modes from basic visuals to hardcore physics simulation, aiming to deliver ultimate visual performance and interactive experience for vehicle building.',
        trackModesTitle: 'Three Operating Modes',
        trackModesDesc: 'Through the connected "Track Controller", you can switch between three core modes in real-time based on vehicle needs:',
        trackModeSimpleTitle: 'Simple Mode',
        trackModeSimpleDesc: 'Ultimate performance optimization, suitable for super-large vehicles or background decorations, as well as lower-spec computers. Only calculates the outermost contour of the wheel group, cannot interact with terrain, providing basic track visual effects with minimal computational cost.',
        trackModeStandardTitle: 'Standard Mode',
        trackModeStandardDesc: 'Default mode, balanced choice, balancing aesthetics and performance. Can accurately identify the concave and convex structure of wheel groups (such as complex suspension shapes and terrain undulation simulation), automatically generates geometric paths that closely follow the contour, with natural chamfer smoothing, suitable for most vehicles.',
        trackModeRealisticTitle: 'Realistic Mode',
        trackModeRealisticDesc: 'Physics simulation and hardcore gameplay, giving tracks real physical properties. Dynamic deformation: tracks are no longer rigid models but real tracks that sag with gravity and deform with terrain; Physics interaction: simulates the vibration from inertia; Break mechanism: when wheels are missing, tracks will realistically fall off (chain break), adding battlefield atmosphere and realism.',
        trackFeaturesTitle: 'Main Features',
        trackFeature1: 'Smart Wheel Fusion: The system automatically detects and merges adjacent coaxial wheels (such as dual-row wheel designs), treating them as a whole for calculation, effectively improving rendering efficiency and preventing redundant calculations.',
        trackFeature2: 'Highly Customizable: Through the GUI interface, you can freely change track plate styles (multiple built-in styles), adjust X/Y/Z axis dimensions, fine-tune spacing, and support HEX code input for custom colors. Realistic mode also supports track tension settings to adjust track sag.',
        trackFeature3: 'Non-standard Wheel Diameter Support: Combined with "Custom Diameter Track Wheel", supports manual input of wheel diameter parameters, ensuring tracks achieve desired effects on any appearance.',
        trackFeature4: 'Performance Optimization: Built-in smart sleep mechanism that automatically reduces calculation frequency when the vehicle is stationary, reducing impact on game frame rate.',
        trackQuickStartTitle: 'Quick Start',
        trackQuickStart1: 'Build: Install tank wheels as usual.',
        trackQuickStart2: 'Connect: Place a "Track Controller" and logically connect all track wheels on the same side to the controller (must form a closed loop or complete logic chain).',
        trackQuickStart3: 'Configure: Press E on the controller to open the settings panel, select mode and adjust appearance.',
        trackQuickStartNote: 'Old creations can also be seamlessly upgraded to tracked versions'
