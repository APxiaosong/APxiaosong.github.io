        trackNote: 'Note: The current track generation algorithm is still experimental. It is normal to encounter any unexpected behavior; please report it to the developers.',
        trackGuide: 'How to use tracks:',
        track1: 'First, connect the wheels in sequence to form a closed loop. If you have two 1x3 wheels placed in series, you can also connect them in a Z-pattern. The connected wheels are the ones used for the track calculation. If your tank has many return rollers, you can selectively skip the ones in the middle to reduce the computational load.',
        track2: 'Next, place a Track Controller and connect it to one of the wheels in the loop to generate the track. Note: The choice of which wheel to connect is important. The entire track\'s rotation and movement animation is based on the rotation of the connected wheel. It is recommended to connect it to a wheel that touches the ground; this simulates friction between the track and the ground, but the drive wheel will slip against the track. If you connect it to the drive wheel, it will prevent it from slipping against the track, but the track itself will slip against the ground.',
        track3: 'When connecting the wheels into a loop, it is recommended to connect them counter-clockwise by default. If you connect them clockwise, it will change the forward orientation of the track.',
        track4: 'If you want the tracks on both sides to face the same forward direction, simply connect them clockwise or counter-clockwise from your current perspective, whether you\'re on the left or right side of the tank. You don\'t need to worry about the overall connection direction for the vehicle as a whole.',
        track5: 'The track effect will be destroyed immediately if a wheel in the loop is destroyed, a connection in the loop is manually removed, or the controller is removed.',
        track6: 'Try to place the Track Controller on the vehicle\'s main body, not on parts that rotate or move (e.g., a tank turret), because the tracks will twitch rapidly when these parts move.',
        track7: 'The track is generated at the average center point of all wheels (e.g., if one wheel is positioned further in and another further out, the track will be rendered midway between them). This is important to be aware of for tanks with misaligned wheels.',
        track8: 'The "Tank Drive Sprocket 2" will not be included in the average center point calculation because it is a half-sided drive wheel.',
        laserTitle: 'About Laser Guidance',
        laser1: 'The transmitter needs a code to be set. To use it, connect and activate a switch, which then allows the Laser Guidance Module to have its code switched manually.',
        laser2: 'When the Laser Guidance Module is connected by a Laser Coding Module, its code is controlled by the Laser Coding Module.',
        laser3: 'A Laser Coding Module can pass its signal on to the next Laser Coding Module.',
        laser4: 'The guidance capability of the Laser Guidance Module must be activated by connecting it to a switch or a logic gate.',
